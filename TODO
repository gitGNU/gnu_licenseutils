how do --remove and --dry-run play together in the copyright command?
  also removing multiple lines problematic.

change the notice command to allow for multiple -c and -l options.

any time we call uncomment twice on some text, it probably won't have the desired result.  this happens in pascal and groff styles.

remove the system mv commands in choose and png-boilerplate.

always check if renames fail
maybe make a single function to do backup files.
