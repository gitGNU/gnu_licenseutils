need a texinfo manual

removing boilerplate changes the mode of the file. need to retain the mode.

png-boilerplate needs a --force option when a copyright notice is encountered.

should png-apply automatically remove the commenting style?

how do --remove and --dry-run play together in the copyright command?
  also removing multiple lines problematic.
