.SH NAME
lush \- a license utility shell
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lush
[\fIOPTION\fR...] [\fIFILE]
.SH DESCRIPTION
lush is a license utility shell used to add copyright and license notices to source code files and PNG files.  The commands that lush recognizes are the same commands that the 
.B licensing
program provides.  lush is an extended bash shell, with an alias for each of the licensing commands.

The effect is that 
.B boilerplate foo.c
in the lush shell is equivalent to typing 
.B licensing boilerplate foo.c
in the system shell.

The available commands are:
.IP
notice: A simple script to write license notices to files.
.IP
boilerplate: Show or remove the boilerplate text at the top of a file.
.IP
help: Show some explanatory text for commands.
.IP
warranty: Show a disclaimer on use of this program.
.IP
welcome: Show the greeting.
.IP
copyright: Add or modify copyright notices in the working boilerplate.
.IP
cbb: Count boilerplate blocks in a file.
.IP
comment: Create a comment block out of some arbitrary text.
.IP
uncomment: Remove comment delimiters but leave the comment text.
.IP
prepend: Put one file onto the start of another.
.IP

.IP

.IP

.IP

.IP

.PP
Some of the commands modify the current working boilerplate and some do not.  The prompt will change to reflect the currently selected commenting style, and the currently selected license.
